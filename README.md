### 2048 Game summary
   In,Board.java, i work on to set up the board and grid size, and part of them
   check if the tile can move four directions(up, down,right,left)when it move
   each direction, the tile will combine and shift to get a new number.and also
   each move, on the board, a new tile will appear. the last part of Board.java
   does check if the game is over when the board can not move to four
   directions.

   play processing, it will read user's input to move direction and to make the
   game keeping going.
